<h1> Why the Muppets? </h1> 
<p>That's the question, isn't it? Why make the Muppets adapt Jane Eyre? <br> Put simply: this.</p>
<p>My initial reasoning for this project was: the Muppets adapted A Christmas Carol, why canâ€™t they do the same for Jane Eyre? Upon reflection, I realized that the Muppets are a lot like Jane Eyre in a sense. Like Jane, the Muppets exist in a weird in-between state of fictionality and reality. Multiple anecdotes from journalists, talk show hosts, and filmmakers show that they often have a hard time distinguishing between the real and the fictional when it comes to the Muppets.
  For one thing, the Muppets exist in their own world with its own canon and intertextual narrative. Calbreath-Frasieur exemplifies this rather nicely with his essay tracking the relationships between the Muppets across multiple media. In this way, we can see the Muppets not only as characters who have evolving roles throughout the many films they are a part of, but also performers whose skills and interpersonal relationships evolve.
  Similarly, Jane has two roles in the novel: she is both narrator and character. The book also presents itself as truth, being subtitled an Autobiography. Even though we now know the novel was written by Charlotte Bronte, it was first published as being edited by her pseudonym, Currer Bell. In The Muppets Christmas Carol, Kermit was the first credited performer, not his puppeteer, Steve Whitmere. In fact, Whitmere and the other puppeteers were not credited until the very end of the movie.</p>
