<h1> Why the Muppets? </h1> 
<p>That's the question, isn't it? Why make the Muppets adapt <em>Jane Eyre</em>? <br> Put simply: this. The Muppets have appeared on TV as themselves in all sorts of places, even including news programs and talk shows, suhc as Larry Bird's.</p>
<p>My initial reasoning for this project was: the Muppets adapted <em>A Christmas Carol</em>, why can’t they do the same for <em>Jane Eyre</em>? Upon reflection, I realized that the Muppets are a lot like Jane Eyre in a sense. Like Jane, the Muppets exist in a weird in-between state of fictionality and reality. Multiple anecdotes from journalists, talk show hosts, and filmmakers show that they often have a hard time distinguishing between the real and the fictional when it comes to the Muppets. </p>
  <p>For one thing, the Muppets exist in their own world with its own canon and intertextual narrative. Aaron Calbreath-Frasieur exemplifies this rather nicely with his essay tracking the relationships between the Muppets across multiple media. In this way, we can see the Muppets not only as characters who have evolving roles throughout the many films they are a part of, but also performers whose skills and interpersonal relationships evolve.
  Similarly, Jane has two roles in the novel: she is both narrator and character. The book also presents itself as truth, being subtitled an Autobiography. Even though we now know the novel was written by Charlotte Bronte, it was first published as being edited by her pseudonym, Currer Bell. In <em>The Muppets Christmas Carol</em>, Kermit was the first credited performer, not his puppeteer, Steve Whitmere. In fact, Whitmere and the other puppeteers were not credited until the very end of the movie.</p>

    <h1 class="headsmall"><em>The Muppets Christmas Carol</em> and how it helped this project</h1>
    <p><em>The Muppet Christmas Carol</em> was instrumental for a few reasons: the way it employed the Muppets, the way it used the source material, and the way that it used music. <em>The Muppet Christmas Carol</em> would often pair Muppets together that had been paired across other Muppet media: most blatantly, this was the two narrators, Gonzo & Rizzo, but Kermit & Piggy and Statler & Waldorf are two other pairings that stood out to me while watching this film.
    </p>
    <p>Another thing that stood out to me in this film was how the screenwriter, Jerry Juhl, often pulled quotes directly from the source material. I have not read the novella in quite some time, but  could recognize some of those iconic lines when spoken by Muppet characters. I don’t think that the scene I have presented for this project has any line-for-line reproductions, but if I were to make this a real thing, I would probably include quite a few lines from the book into my own screenplay. But of course, that gets into the issue of tone, which I will touch on later.
    </p>
    <p><em>The Muppet Christmas Carol</em>used music to move the story along, as any good musical is wont to do. While I enjoy musicals as a consumer, writing them is just not in my wheelhouse. I thought of a few instances where musical numbers could be inserted into <em>Jane Eyre</em>; my first idea was for Brocklehurst (played by Sam Eagle) to have a patter song explaining all the intricacies of Lowood to young Jane. Another idea I had for a musical number in this film is a big ending number that wraps the story up. I decided that, in the universe of this show, Alan Menken would write these songs. There's no real significance in that other than the fact that I really like Alan Menken’s music and he, like the Muppets, is heavily associated with Disney.
